On **Tuesday 5 August 2025**, the Edinburgh Fringe continued to brim with comedy shows that cut deep, surprise, and thoughtfully play with form. Here’s what’s grabbing critics’ attention and building buzz.

## Noteworthy Reviews from Today

- **Cat Cohen – _Broad Strokes_ (Pleasance Courtyard)**  
  Cohen returns triumphantly after a health scare, using her wry millennial persona to navigate recovery and stress. The show fuses stand‑up and musical segments, with character voices and emotional transparency that land consistently.

- **Palestine: Peace de Resistance (Pleasance Dome)**  
  Sami Abu Wardeh blends historical storytelling, puppetry, anti‑colonial satire, and personal memories to craft a clown‑inflected show that resists easy categorisation—boldly comedic yet politically charged.

- **Philosophy of the World (Summerhall)**  
  An intentionally chaotic and anarchic take on cult band The Shaggs. Its disordered, raw energy seems entirely the point—humour that disrupts and defies structure.

### What to Watch Tonight

- **Emotional & Musical Comedy** like *Broad Strokes* pushes boundaries of tone and storytelling.  
- **Political‑theatrical comedy** like *Palestine: Peace de Resistance* highlights storytelling as activism.  
- **Radical absurdity**, exemplified by *Philosophy of the World*, proves form itself can be comedic fuel.  
- Previewed names from *Guardian* and *Times* suggest the rest of the week will continue to deliver both surprises and savagely smart stand‑up.
