**Wednesday 20 August 2025** delivered highlights from bold new voice and famed Edinburgh regulars, perfectly demonstrating the depth of this year's comedy offerings.

## Reviews of the Day

- **Ivo Graham – _Orange Crush_ (Pleasance Courtyard)**  
  Graham riffs charmingly on his favourite colour—orange—through anecdotes ranging from Irn-Bru and Wotsits to personal reflections on his mother's MS, Swindon Town, and support for Palestine. While his confident presence may lack some earlier relatability, the show bursts with clever highlights, especially when skewering rapper Drake and satirising Eton privilege.

- **Jamali Maddix – _Aston_ (Monkey Barrel)**  
  Maddix delivers his trademark blunt humour with raw honesty—tackling topics like aging, toxic online culture, and identity with sharp, if uneven, social commentary. His mythic “racist utopia” sketch stands out for incisive satire and thought-provoking comedy, even if some edges don’t fully land.
