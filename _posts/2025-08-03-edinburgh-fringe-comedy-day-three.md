## Emerging themes (from early reviews)

- **Character comedy & clowning** are prominent (Treen, Widick, Adler; plus Saturday’s Cabbage the Clown).  
- **Confessional / personal narratives** continue to land — but with bite (Norris; elements in Tothill).

## Looking ahead — hot tickets & previews

- _The Scotsman_’s **Hot Tickets** list signposts returning and big‑buzz comedians to book early: **Amy Gledhill**, **Amy Mason**, **Ania Magliano**, **Chloe Petts**, and more.

### Quick picks for tonight
If you want a cross‑section of what critics are already talking about today: **Tothill** (finely honed persona), **Treen** (character silliness), and **Adler** (full‑tilt theatrical energy) make a varied triple.
