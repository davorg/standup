**Tuesday 19 August 2025**, deep into the Fringe's final stretch, brought nuanced takes on pressing topics and heartfelt storytelling across standout comedy sets.

## Reviews of the Day

- **Zainab Johnson – _Toxically Optimistic_ (Pleasance Courtyard)**  
  Johnson opens with a bold *“I’ve got a gun”*, diving headfirst into a thoughtful and sharp comedy hour that explores gun ownership, safety, and identity—especially through the lens of a Black Muslim American woman. The tone is sleek, confident, and insightful, with one especially memorable twist ending.

- **Liam Withnail – _Big Strong Boy_ (Monkey Barrel)**  
  Withnail revisits his misfit youth in Dagenham with warmth and wit, exploring teenage angst, family quirks, and redemption against the question “Are you happy?”. The show balances emotional depth with punchy, self-aware comedy.
