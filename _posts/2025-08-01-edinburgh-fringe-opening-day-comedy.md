Here’s a comedy-focused roundup of what was noteworthy on the **opening day of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Friday 1 August 2025**:

## Highlights from 1 August 2025 — Comedy at the Fringe

### 1. Fringe Kicks Off with Star-Studded Comedy Line-Up
On the very first day, the 2025 Fringe launched with a vibrant slate of comedy shows spanning stand-up, character comedy, musical satire, and more. Standouts teased in advance included:

- **Desiree Burch** returning with *The Golden Wrath*, tackling the midlife crisis and menopause.  
- **Joe Kent-Walters** reviving the quirky Frankie Monroe in *DEAD!!! (Good Fun Time)*.  
- **Lorna Rose Treen** offering her eccentric character-driven *24 Hour Diner People*.  
- **Urooj Ashfaq** presenting *How to Be a Baddie*, a playful riff on self-reinvention.  
- On the musical theatre side:  
  - *Hot Mess*, blending pop and climate change.  
  - *A Jaffa Cake Musical*, debating whether the beloved snack is a biscuit or a cake with catchy songs.

A Scotsman roundup published on 1 August acknowledged the explosion of shows that immediately stood out. Although the full list wasn’t accessible, it confirmed that critics had already awarded four- and five-star reviews to several comedy acts right at the festival’s opening.
