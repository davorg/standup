With the first night behind us, **Day Two of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe (2 August 2025)** is when the comedy programme really kicks into gear. While early reviews are still trickling in, the buzz is all about the big names, rising stars, and unusual shows to look forward to over the rest of the festival.

## Big Names Returning to the Fringe
Several familiar faces from television and past Fringes are back this year:

- **Frankie Boyle** – never one to avoid controversy, returning with a sharp new hour.  
- **Sara Pascoe** – mixing social commentary with her trademark warmth.  
- **Ed Byrne** – reflecting on middle age, politics, and parenting.  
- **Fern Brady** – bringing her caustic wit to the Pleasance.  
- **David O’Doherty** – songs, bikes, and whimsy on the big stage.  

These acts are guaranteed to draw sell‑out crowds across August.

## Rising Stars to Watch
Beyond the household names, critics and insiders are tipping several acts as potential breakouts:

- **Urooj Ashfaq** with *How to Be a Baddie*, a playful take on self‑reinvention.  
- **Dan Tiernan** in *All In*, building on award buzz from 2024.  
- **Krystal Evans** with *A Star is Burnt*, raw confessional stand‑up from the hospitality trenches.  
- **Lorna Rose Treen**, fresh from Best Newcomer acclaim, stretching her surreal characters even further.  

These are the shows that could be the word‑of‑mouth hits of 2025.

## Comedy with a Twist
The Fringe is also known for its off‑beat experiments that blur genre lines:

- **Tartan Tabletop** – a live Dungeons & Dragons comedy adventure.  
- **Hot Mess** – musical satire about climate change.  
- **A Jaffa Cake Musical** – answering the age‑old biscuit‑versus‑cake question in song.  

Expect laughter, but also surprise, improvisation, and audience involvement.

## What to Expect This Weekend
The first weekend traditionally sets the tone for the rest of the month. Audiences can look forward to:

- Packed late‑night showcases at The Stand and Monkey Barrel.  
- Critics filing their first round of reviews (which can make or break smaller acts).  
- Social media buzz pushing unexpected names into the spotlight.

**In short:** The second day of the Fringe is all about anticipation. The stars are shining, the newcomers are hungry, and the city is filling with audiences eager to discover the next big thing in comedy.
