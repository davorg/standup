**Thursday 7 August 2025** brought a strong wave of **comedy reviews** across the Fringe. Here are the key picks and takeaways — with primary sources linked.

## Reviews Published Today (7 Aug)

- **Joe Kent‑Walters – _Frankie Monroe: DEAD!!! (Good Fun Time)_ (Monkey Barrel / CabVol1)**  
  Garish, surreal and gloriously unhinged: Kent‑Walters resurrects nightclub ghoul Frankie to battle gentrification with audience‑driven chaos.  
  → [The Guardian review](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/aug/07/joe-kent-walters-is-frankie-monroe-dead-good-fun-time-review-cabvol1-at-monkey-barrel-edinburgh)

- **_Hot Mess_ (Pleasance Courtyard)** — musical comedy/satire  
  A smart climate‑romcom where **Earth** dates **Humanity**; witty songs meet sharp jokes without preachiness.  
  → [The Guardian review](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/aug/07/hot-mess-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh)

- **Liam Tulley – _Baldilocks_ (Just the Tonic @ The Mash House)**  
  Downbeat delivery and self‑deprecation power a no‑frills, low‑status hour about dating disasters and health scares.  
  → [Chortle review](https://www.chortle.co.uk/review/2025/08/07/58695/liam_tulley%3A_baldilocks)

- **Hasan Al‑Habib – _Death to the West (Midlands)_ (Pleasance Courtyard)**  
  Don’t be fooled by the title: proud Brummie storytelling that leans into identity with warmth and bite.

- **Rosco McClelland – _How Could Hell Be Any Worse?_ (Monkey Barrel)**  
  A big year for the Glasgow comic; kinetic presence and mordant observations keep the room on its toes.
